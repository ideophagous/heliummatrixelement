# heliummatrixelement

This project was made during my second year as a master student in Babe»ô-Bolyai University.

Calculating the <1s1s|H|3d3d> matrix element for helium, using hydrogen-like wavefunctions.

- Calculating the radial integral numerically with analytical verification

- Writing a report of the problem:

  - Presentation of the theory

  - Analytical calculations

  - Explaining the numerical methods

  - Numerical convergence analysis

  - Discussion of results obtained from both methods
